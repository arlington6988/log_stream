# log_stream
Streams log file to browser being written to by external script.  Action::Live streaming with rails in this fashion is supported by Chrome browsers.  This is a quick convenient way to get a log file from external script or process to display in the browser to the user.  It does not require re-inventing the wheel or tons of other gems.  Refer to the stream method in the stream controller for the real meat of this project.  I uploaded this to the hub because when searching for a function to accomplish this I could not locate anything this did not require many other gems and dependencies.
